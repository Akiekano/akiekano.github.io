        <p>Hi, I’m Fernanda Ma'rouf, a versatile and passionate software engineer with a deep focus on
            creating robust, scalable applications that drive innovation. My expertise spans a wide range
            of technologies, including Go (Golang), C++, Rust, and Node.js, where I build systems
            optimized for performance, reliability, and efficiency. I have a comprehensive understanding
            of Linux environments, and I excel at DevOps practices, enabling me to streamline CI/CD
            pipelines, automate infrastructure management, and ensure seamless, scalable deployment
            processes. My technical toolkit also includes low-level languages like Assembly, giving me the
            ability to work closely with hardware and optimize systems at their core. In addition to my
            backend strengths, I have a solid grasp of front-end development, allowing me to bridge the
            gap between user interface and backend logic, ensuring cohesive and fluid user experiences.
            Whether working with React, Material UI, or other modern front-end frameworks, I’m able to
            design intuitive, responsive interfaces that complement the functionality of the underlying
            system. My passion also extends into the world of Artificial Intelligence, where I’ve explored
            fields like Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision. These skills have empowered
            me to build intelligent applications capable of processing and interpreting human language, as
            well as performing real-time object detection and classification using Convolutional Neural
            Networks (CNNs) and TensorFlow. With a strong focus on writing clean, maintainable code, I
            continuously strive to push the boundaries of technology. My goal is to deliver innovative
            solutions that are adaptable to the ever-changing landscape of software development while
            ensuring the scalability and robustness needed to handle the challenges of tomorrow.</p>
