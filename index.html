                    <p>Tohka is a girl with very long, dark-purple hair usually tied back with a ribbon of sorts, and matching dark purple eyes with white irises. <br>
                         she had a cold, and emotionless demeanor. She was very wary of humans due to her being constantly 
                         attacked by the AST before Shido finally got the chance to talk to her.</p>

                        Sheele was an airhead, often losing her glasses or failing at any chores she tried to do due to clumsiness,
                        however, she was very kind and caring to her friends, 
                        willing to sacrifice her life for them, as seen with Mine..</p>

                        Echidna's curiosity toward the unknown and her thirst for knowledge are the two things that define her
                        behavior, At first glance, she is polite, soft-spoken, understanding,
                        and even a bit childish. She is stated by the other Witches to be quite clumsy like the time when she accidentally set the
                        forest on fire, nearly burning to death, as she was trying to warm herself..</p>
